    <h1>Pistachio Chip Ice Cream</h1>

    <p>This pistachio chip ice cream brings the flavors of the popular Dubai chocolate bar to a <br>
        no-churn ice cream. Studded with roasted, salted pistachios and dark chocolate chips, this recipe <br>
        is made with an easy milk syrup, invented by Chef John, instead of using the typical shortcut for no-churn desserts, <br>
        sweetened condensed milk. For best results, chill all of your tools, containers, and ingredients so that everything <br>
        stays cool.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/3 cup pistachio butter</li>
        <li>2 drops almond extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 drop green gel food coloring</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream, ice cold</li>
        <li>1/2 cup roasted salted pistachios, <strong>plus more for sprinkling</strong></li>
        <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine sugar and milk in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Boil mixture <br>
            for 3 minutes, then turn off the heat and pour into a bowl. Let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add pistachio butter, almond extract, vanilla extract, and green food coloring. Whisk together, then refrigerate <br>
            until completely chilled, about 2 hours.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour very cold whipping cream into a large mixing bowl, and whisk until soft peaks form. Transfer in half the pistachio <br>
            mixture, and mix briefly to combine. Add remaining pistachio mixture and mix just until combined.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Use a spatula to transfer the mixture into a frozen container. Sprinkle half the nuts and chocolate chips over the top, and <br>
            stir gently with a fork until distributed evenly. Scatter remaining chips and nuts over the top as evenly as possible.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place a piece of plastic wrap on top of the ice cream, cover with the lid, and transfer to a freezer until completely <br>
            frozen, at least 4 hours and preferably overnight.
        <br>
        <li>Scoop and serve sprinkled with chopped or grated pistachios.</li>
    </ol>
